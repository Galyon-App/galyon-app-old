		<br>
		<br>
		<h3><b>Installing Ionic</b></h3>
		<p>Ionic apps are created and developed primarily through the Ionic command-line utility. The Ionic CLI is the
			preferred
			method of installation, as it offers a wide range of dev tools and help options along the way. It is also
			the main tool
			through which to run the app and connect it to other services, such as Ionic Appflow.</p>
		<h3><b>Install the Ionic CLI</b></h3>
		Before proceeding, make sure your computer has <a
			href="https://ionicframework.com/docs/reference/glossary#node">Node.js</a> installed. <a
			href="https://ionicframework.com/docs/intro/environment">See these instructions</a>
		to set up an environment for
		Ionic.
		<p></p>
		<h3><b> Install the Ionic CLI with npm:</b></h3>
		<pre>
		npm install -g @ionic/cli
		</pre>
		<p>If there was a previous installation of the Ionic CLI, it will need to be uninstalled due to a change in
			package name.</p>
		<pre>
		npm uninstall -g ionic
		npm install -g @ionic/cli
		</pre>
		<p>For More Installations guide follow <a href="https://ionicframework.com/docs/intro/cli">this instructions</a>

		<h3 id="apisetup"><strong>D) API setup</strong> - <a href="#toc">top</a></h3>
		<p>
			CodeIgniter is a powerful PHP framework with a very small footprint, built for developers who need a simple
			and elegant
			toolkit to create full-featured web applications.
		</p>
		<p>We have used <b> CodeIgniter version 3.1.11 </b> for APIs </p>
		<p>Let's Integrate APIs in your app</p>
		<p>open environment.ts file in src/environment folder, here you can find two environment file, one is for debug
			mode and
			one is for production mode. you can set your credentials here for better security</p>
		<p>Visit Website for more about CodeIgniter and installation <a
				href="https://codeigniter.com/userguide3/installation/index.html">here</a> </p>
		<p>Now as you can see in below image, we have set many credentials for various apis</p>
		<img src="assets/images/env.png" alt="" style="width: 100%;">
		<br>
		<br>
		<h2 style="text-transform: uppercase;"> <b> There are 5 Steps for integrate API to your apps</b> </h2>

		<!-- Step 1 -->

		<h3 style="text-transform: uppercase;"> <b>Step 1 : Database </b> </h3>

		<p>First step to integrate api is for your app is to create database in your live or local phpmyadmin, here we
			are configured it to live server </p>
		<p> for this open you cPANEL and open link called MYSQL Database as shown in image below </p>
		<img src="assets/images/api2.png" alt="" style="width: 100%;">
		<p> Once you click on MYSQL Database link it will redirect you to page, where we can create/manage
			database,user.
		</p>
		<p>Now first create databse for our APIs as shown in image below, give suitable name to your database</p>
		<img src="assets/images/api3.png" alt="" style="width: 100%;">
		<p> After successfully creating database you have to add it to database.sql file find in source code. copy the
			name of database as shown in image below</p>
		<img src="assets/images/api4.png" alt="" style="width: 100%;">
		<p> Now Open App_code folder and open database.sql file in Code Editor as shown in image below </p>
		<img src="assets/images/db.png" alt="" style="width: 100%;">
		<p>And Change name to newly newly created database name as shown in image below</p>
		<img src="assets/images/api5.png" alt="" style="width: 100%;">
		<p> Next step is to create database user, for that in same MYSQL Database page scroll down and you will find
			MYSQL Users Section and Add New User Section </p>
		<p>Now Create User with giving suitable username and password as shown in image below</p>
		<img src="assets/images/api6.png" alt="" style="width: 100%;">
		<p> After successfully creating user, we have to add this user to our database, in order to do that just scroll
			down MYSQL Database page, you can see the section called Add User To Database as shown in image below </p>
		<p>Select Recently created database user that you have created, and click Add button</p>
		<img src="assets/images/api7.png" alt="" style="width: 100%;">
		<p>Now it will redircting you to permission page for database, now select all the permission as shown image
			below and click submit button</p>
		<img src="assets/images/api8.png" alt="" style="width: 100%;">
		<p>Now our database is ready to use, now go to home page of cPANEL and click on phpmyadmin and it will
			redircting you to the phpmyadmin console page as shown in image below </p>
		<img src="assets/images/api9.png" alt="" style="width: 100%;">
		<p>Now select database you have created and in phpmyadmin console and click on import section on top of the
			screen as shown in image below and try to import or drag and drop database.sql from App_code folder </p>
		<img src="assets/images/api10.png" alt="" style="width: 100%;">
		<p>Wait a minute our database will execute and create database for you as shown in image below</p>
		<img src="assets/images/api11.png" alt="" style="width: 100%;">
		<!-- Step 1 -->

		<!-- Step 2 -->
		<h3 style="text-transform: uppercase;"> <b>Step 2 : APIs Setup</b> </h3>
		<p> Now our database is ready to use for rest APIs, ok so next step is to add connection between PHP CodeIgniter
			to Database, here CodeIgniter provide bridge between it, called database config, in order to do that you
			have to add, username/password and database name to the CodeIgniter
		</p>
		<p>Now Open App_code folder and open folder called API(CodeIgniter project) as shown in image below</p>
		<img src="assets/images/folder.png" alt="" style="width: 100%;">
		<img src="assets/images/db.png" alt="" style="width: 100%;">

		<p>Open file API/application/config/database.php as shown in image below</p>
		<img src="assets/images/api12.png" alt="" style="width: 100%;">

		<p>Here we have used to different variables called debug and prod commented, </p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				Debug for localhost
			</li>
			<li>
				prod for live server
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p>If you wanted to test locally just comment out prod variables or if you wanted to run it live just comment
			out debug variables</p>
		<p>Now add username, password recently created user in MYSQL Database and database which we have created in same
		</p>
		<p>Done with database connection, Yeepee!!</p>

		<!-- Step 2 -->

		<!-- Step 3 -->
		<h3 style="text-transform: uppercase;"> <b>Step 3 : Upload APIs</b> </h3>
		<p>Uploading APIs or Make it live on server is easy, here you can upload it to sub domain or in primary domain,
			we suggest you to upload it in sub domain. we will demonstrate it on sub domain. </p>
		<p> In order to create sub domain visit cPanel Home page and find Domains Sections and click on Subdomains as
			shown in image below</p>
		<img src="assets/images/api13.png" alt="" style="width: 100%;">
		<p>It will redirecting you to sub domain page as shown in image below, no give suitable name to your sub domain.
			and give default path from system. in image below you can see your Path Will be mentioned in Document Root.
		</p>
		<img src="assets/images/api14.png" alt="" style="width: 100%;">
		<p>After your Subdomain successfully created, visit File Manager from cPanel Home page as shown in image below
		</p>
		<img src="assets/images/api15.png" alt="" style="width: 100%;">
		<p>As You can see from page your subdomain folder will be created. in our demonstrate example our folder will
			called as
			grocery-api.initstore.net as shown in image below</p>
		<img src="assets/images/api16.png" alt="" style="width: 100%;">
		<p>
			Now open that folder and upload API folder as shown in image below, you can find upload button on top
			toolbar
		</p>
		<img src="assets/images/api17.png" alt="" style="width: 100%;">
		<p>After uploading API zip file, extract it make it root like this. in image below</p>
		<img src="assets/images/api18.png" alt="" style="width: 100%;">
		<p>Yeepee API Uploading is done!! Now verify your API by visit subdomain in our demonstrate case we have this
			url : <a href="http://grocery-api.initstore.net/">http://grocery-api.initstore.net/</a>
		</p>
		<p>Once you see message like in image below then everything is fine. otherwise there will be issue on database
			connections like username,password,database</p>
		<img src="assets/images/api19.png" alt="" style="width: 100%;">

		<!-- Step 3 -->

		<!-- Step 4 -->
		<h3 style="text-transform: uppercase;"> <b>Step 4 : Configuration</b> </h3>

		<p>After successfully uploading API, there few more things too be setup before proceeding to APP side. </p>
		<p> Once you done uploading API with success message, first thing we have to add some configurations in API
			project </p>
		<ol>
			<li> <b>open applications/config/config.php</b> </li>
			<p>
				Find code <br>
				<b>"$config['base_url'] = 'YOUR_BASE_URL/';"</b> <br>
				and change base_url to your domain name, in our
				demonstrate
				case we will change it to this
				<br>
				<b>"$config['base_url'] = 'YOUR_BASE_URL/';"</b>
				<br>
				<b>Make sure your domain ends with index.php/</b>
			</p>
			<li> <b>Second is to add encryption_key for security purpose while using data from database </b>
				<p>
					Find code in same file <br>
					<b>" $config['encryption_key'] = 'YOUR_ENCRYPTION_KEY';"</b> <br>
					this will be your auth token while calling api from apps remember this, let me put this as <br>
					<b>"$config['encryption_key'] = '123456';"</b>
				</p>
			</li>
		</ol>

		<h3 style="text-transform: uppercase;"> <b>Step 5 : Contact Informations</b> </h3>

		<p>Open file in APIs application/models/Users_model.php and change information according to you as shown in
			image below </p>
		<img src="assets/images/contactinformations.png" alt="" width="100%">
		<!-- Step 4 -->
		<br>
		<hr>
		<br>
		<h3 id="emailSetup"><strong>E) Email Setup</strong> - <a href="#toc">top</a></h3>
		<p>By default, you have no email account set up. The main username may look like it is set up as an email, but
			if you wish
			to use it, you will need to add it as an email account. The video and instructions below will guide you
			through creating
			and accessing an email account in cPanel.
		</p>
		<p>To create an email account:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Log into cPanel</li>
			<li>In the <strong>Email</strong> section, click <strong>Email Accounts</strong>.</li>
			<li>In the <strong>Email</strong> field, type your preferred username and select the domain name from the
				drop-down
				menu below.
				<div class="look_here"><strong>Note:</strong> The email name <strong>shadow</strong>&nbsp;is reserved
					and cannot
					be used for an email address.</div>
			</li>
			<li>In the <strong>Password</strong> fields, type the desired password twice.</li>
			<li>Make a selection for <strong>Mailbox Quota</strong>.</li>
			<li>Click <strong>Create Account</strong>.</li>
		</ol>
		<img src="assets/images/mail1.png" alt="" width="100%">
		<img src="assets/images/mail2.png" alt="" width="100%">
		<img src="assets/images/mail3.png" alt="" width="100%">

		<p> In our app we have used mail system to send Password reset, Welcome email, general email, and others in
			order to use this feature it's required to change email to your newly created mail </p>

		<p>We have to change email from three files, just find and replace with newly created mail</p>
		<ol>
			<li> <b> application/models/Users_model.php </b> </li>
			<li> <b> application/models/Driver_model.php </b> </li>
			<li> <b> applications/core/Main_model.php </b> </li>
		</ol>

		<p>Change <br>
		<pre>yourmail@domain.com</pre> <br>
		to Your Newly created mail <br>

		<pre>mail@xyz.com</pre>
		</p>

		<h3 id="adminConfigure"><strong>F) Admin App Configuration</strong> - <a href="#toc">top</a></h3>
		<h3 style="text-transform: uppercase;"> <b> </b> </h3>
		<p>
			After successfully configuare and adding base_url and encryption_key to the applications/config/config.php
			we are now ready to use this api and calling it into mobile app and website
		</p>
		<h2> <b>Please upload atleast one language in order to run the app. we provided language in translations
				folder.. called translations. we suggest to upload en.json from admin panel</b> </h2>
		<p> <b>Note: Setup and adding APIs is comman in all app</b> </p>
		<p>Here for Mobile,website,and Admin panel is made up with Angular and they all have same structure, so there is
			no any confusion for setup it to other </p>
		<p> <b>We will first setup Admin Panel</b> </p>
		<p>Follow this step in order to configure</p>
		<p>Open App_code Folder and you will find folder called Admin_app in your text editor</p>
		<p>Now we have to change environment files in source code to do that open src/environments folder and edit both
			file environments.ts and environments.prod.ts file </p>
		<p>Change baseURL to our apis endpoint, in our case we have <br>
			baseURL : = <b> "YOUR_BASE_URL/" </b> <br>
			mediaURL : = <b> "YOUR_BASE_URL/uploads/" </b>
		</p>
		<p>Make sure this url is same in every app's environments files </p>
		<p>Change authToken value to encryption_key's value which we have added in APIs applications/config/config.php
			file </p>
		<p> <b>Note : authToken must be same as API's applications/config/config.php "$config['encryption_key']" value
			</b> </p>
		<p> <b>Note : This configuration is same in every app, UserApp,DriverApp,StoreApp,WebApp,AdminApp <br>
				you have to add this value in same both file environments.ts and environments.prod.ts file </b> </p>
		<p>Please find image below for more</p>

		<p>For accepting payment from stripe we need stripe keys, follow this link for more about stripe keys <a

		<h3>Follow the instructions closely and it will work smoothly!
		</h3>
		<p>Create and confirm your free Stripe account</p>
		<p>Creating a Stripe account is free and you can delete it anytime. If you already have a Stripe account (for
			another
			project), it's better to create a new one to avoid any interference.
			<br>
			Note that right now, once you have configured your Stripe account in your Sharetribe marketplace, you won't
			be able to
			change it to another one. You can always update all details (bank account, account name...) in your Stripe
			dashboard but
			using another new account later isn't possible for the time being.
			<br>
			To create your Stripe account:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Go to <a href="https://dashboard.stripe.com/register">https://dashboard.stripe.com/register</a></li>
			<img src="assets/images/stripe1.png" alt="" width="100%">
			<li>Fill in the required fields, then create your Stripe account</li>
			<p></p>
			<p>Great! You can skip the first question by clicking "Skip for now" and you now have to confirm your Stripe
				email to
				confirm your account.
			</p>
			<p></p>
			<h3>Confirm your Stripe account</h3>
			<p>To confirm your Stripe email and account:</p>
			<p></p>
			<li>Check your email inbox and look for a confirmation email sent from Stripe (by <a
					href="mailto:support@stripe.com" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"
					target="_blank"><i>support@stripe.com</i></a>) named <i>Confirm your Stripe
					email address!</i>
			</li>
			<img src="assets/images/stripe2.png" alt="" width="100%">
			<li>Click the confirmation link in this email and log in with your credentials recently created</li>
			<img src="assets/images/stripe3.jpeg" alt="" width="100%">
			<p>Yeah! Your Stripe account is now confirmed. You should now activate it to be able to receive money via
				this Stripe
				account.</p>
			<h3><b>Activate your Stripe account
				</b></h3>
			<p>As you will receive money from your users via your Stripe account, you have to provide some details such
				as your address
				and your bank account. This data is secured by Stripe and won't be shared with anyone.
			</p>
			<p>To activate your Stripe account:</p>
			<li>Log in your Stripe account and click the Activate your account link in the left menu.</li>
			<img src="assets/images/stripe4.png" alt="" width="100%">


			<li>Complete all the fields according to the instructions and set <i>Your website</i> to your Sharetribe
				marketplace
				address when asked. It's OK to activate your account as an individual, you don't need a company ID.
				Stripe may
				review your account later but you are able to activate it immediately.</li>
			<li>The activation form varies based on your country, so select that first!</li>
			<li>Any doubts or questions? <a href="mailto:help@sharetribe.com" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"
					target="_blank">Contact Sharetribe's support</a>.</li>
			<li>Once completed, click "Activate account".</li>
			<li>Your Stripe account may still need to be reviewed by Stripe. It's automatic, and it should be a very
				quick
				process.</li>
			<img src="assets/images/stripe5.png" alt="" width="100%">
			<li>After the automatic activation process, you may need to provide additional information to Stripe for
				identity
				verification. If you get this notification, click on "Review" on the dashboard as shown below. If you
				are not prompted
				for additional information, you can move to the next step.</li>
			<img src="assets/images/stripe6.png" alt="" width="100%">
			<p>Good job! Now you need to enable Connect in your platform so your sellers can add their bank details in
				their settings.
			</p>
			<h3>Enable Stripe Connect in your platform</h3>
			<p>Sharetribe uses the Stripe Connect features with Custom Accounts and you have to enable it to enjoy those
				features.</p>
			<p><b>This step is important: without this step, providers will not be able to receive money and buyers will
					not be able to
					start any transaction.
				</b></p>
			<h3>To enable Stripe Connect:</h3>
			<li>Click the Connect left menu item.</li>
			<img src="assets/images/stripe7.png" alt="" width="100%">
			<li>Click the Get started button.</li>
			<img src="assets/images/stripe8.png" alt="" width="100%">
			<li>Select "Build a platform or marketplace" from the prompt.</li>
			<img src="assets/images/stripe9.png" alt="" width="100%">
			<p>At this point, Stripe may have to review your account. If that's the case, <a
					href="https://help.sharetribe.com/sharetribe-go-payments-and-transactions/online-payments-with-stripe/how-to-apply-for-stripe-connect-review-us-accounts-only">you
					can learn more about this process here</a>.</p>
			<li>After a few seconds or the review process, you should see your Connect dashboard. From the left sidebar,
				go to
				<i>Settings</i> then <i>Connect settings</i>, at <a href="https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings"
					rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings</a>
			</li>
			<img src="assets/images/stripe10.png" alt="" width="100%">

			<li>Make sure that <i>Custom</i> is enabled in the <i>Account types</i> section.&nbsp;</li>
			<li>If you see a message on this screen that your platform profile needs to be completed, click "Start" on
				the
				notification and provide the additional information required.&nbsp;</li>
			<li>Stripe may still need to review your platform and account details. However, you can already move to the
				next
				step.&nbsp;</li>
			<img src="assets/images/stripe11.png" alt="" width="100%">
			<p>Great! You now have to get your API keys and input them into your marketplace.</p>
			<h3>Get your API keys from Stripe and add them to your Sharetribe marketplace</h3>
			<p>API keys are some text strings that have one technical purpose: link your Sharetribe marketplace with
				your Stripe
				account, so you can manage payments in your marketplace.</p>
			<p>First, get your API keys from Stripe:</p>
			<li>Click "Developers" → "API Keys" in the left menu item.</li>
			<img src="assets/images/stripe12.png" alt="" width="100%">
			<li>Make sure that <b>you are not using test data</b>. If this is the case, switch the <i>View test data</i>
				toggle.
				Test API keys will <b>not</b> work in your Sharetribe marketplace.</li>
			<img src="assets/images/stripe13.png" alt="" width="100%">
			<li>Copy the value from the <i>Publishable key</i> row, from the <i>Token</i> column. It should look like
				<code>pk_live_somelongrandomvaluelikeVqFze9etc</code>&nbsp;
			</li>
			<li>Go back to your Stripe account, in the API tab and click the Reveal live key token button.</li>
			<img src="assets/images/stripe15.png" alt="" width="100%">

			<li>A new window will pop up with the secret key. <b>Note: You won't be able to see the key again after
					this. Make
					sure you copy it and save it somewhere safe and private.</b>
			</li>
			<li>Copy the value of the <i>Secret key</i>. It should look like
				sk_live_somelongrandomvaluelike0Rx3jvetc&nbsp;</li>
			<li>Paste this key Admin Panels payment section inside stripe keys </li>
			<img src="assets/images/stripeadmin.png" alt="" width="100%">
			<p>That's it! You have now connected your Stripe account and are ready to receive payments in your app!</p>

		<img src="assets/images/paytm4.png" alt="" width="100%">
		<h3>Fundamentals of collecting payments with Paytm:</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Your customer clicks on Pay button in your web/mobile application.</li>
			<li>Customer is shown a checkout form where she fills her payment details and authorizes the payment.</li>
			<li>After completion of transaction, Paytm posts the response (success or failed) on a Callback URL defined
				by you.
			</li>
			<li>As a <u>recommended</u> security measure, you validate each transaction response via a server-to-server
				(S2S)
				API call. Transaction revalidation protects from request/response tampering possible in browser calls.
				This S2S
				call is not required for Paytm plugins and hosted e-commerce website integration solutions.</li>
			<li>Based on the response received, you display order status to customer.</li>
			<li>See a real-time summary of payments received and other insights in your <a
					href="https://dashboard.paytm.com" target="_blank">dashboard</a>.</li>
			<li>Receive payments collected from customers in your bank account on next business day.</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>Detailed Payment Flow Explained</h3>
		<h5>Transaction Creation</h5>
		<p>When a transaction request is received at Paytm's server, there are multiple validations carried out like
			valid
			source of request, structure of request, uniqueness of request etc. Once these validations are passed, a
			transaction
			is created.</p>
		<hr>
		<h5>Successful Transaction</h5>
		<p>Customer fills basic payment details to authorize the payment. Once the authorization is successful, money is
			debited
			from customer’s account. This transaction is a successful transaction.
		</p>
		<hr>
		<h5>Failed Transaction</h5>
		<p>If the customer drops out from the payment process or in the event of payment authorization failure, money is
			not
			deducted from customer’s account. This is marked as failed transaction.
		</p>
		<hr>
		<h5>Pending Transaction</h5>
		<p>Sometimes Paytm doesn't receive real-time transaction status from the bank. This can be due to many reasons
			such as
			network issues, technical errors at customer's/bank's end etc. This is marked as pending transaction. Refer
			this for
			detailed handling of pending transaction.
		</p>
		<hr>
		<h5>Settled Transaction</h5>
		<p>Payments received against successful transactions are credited into your bank account on T+1, where T is the
			date of
			successful transaction. Once the payment is credited, corresponding transaction is marked as Settled.
		</p>
		<hr>
		<h5>Refund Transaction</h5>
		<p>Sometimes there are use cases where you need to reverse payments for successful or settled transactions. The
			reversal
			transaction of a successful or settled payment is called refund transaction. Refer <a
				href="/docs/refund-management">Refunds</a> for more details.</p>
